//TODO Write a script in WebGL2 Which willtake a input of a array?of particles there.positions.and use.transform feedback.to keep track of positions andstate of each particle.and to start I want all the particles to be scattered.randomly throughout.the canvas height.and width.Then I want them to be able to converge on a predefinedpoint within the 3D spaceand if they'rethere was a sphere around that point.I would want them to come in at the very edge of the sphere wherever they're coming towards the point. And then onceit gets there to orbit around the point In 3D space. until told to stop.
