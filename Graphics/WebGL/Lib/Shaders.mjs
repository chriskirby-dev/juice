/**
 * 

A vertex shader and a fragment shader are both essential components of the programmable pipeline in modern graphics programming (such as OpenGL or WebGL), but they serve different purposes and operate at different stages in the rendering process.

1. Vertex Shader
Purpose: Processes each vertex of a 3D object.
Responsibilities:
Transforms vertices from object space to clip space (via matrices like the model-view-projection matrix).
Handles vertex attributes like position, normals, texture coordinates, and colors.
Can perform per-vertex operations like lighting or deformation (such as skeletal animation).
Outputs data (such as transformed position and other attributes) to be passed to the fragment shader.
Input: Receives vertex attributes (e.g., positions, normals, UVs).
Output: Provides transformed vertex positions and data for the fragment shader to use.
Example: A vertex shader might take the position of a vertex in 3D space, apply a matrix transformation to convert it to screen space, and pass texture coordinates and other data to the next stage.

2. Fragment Shader (also known as Pixel Shader)
Purpose: Processes each fragment (which corresponds to a potential pixel on the screen).
Responsibilities:
Computes the final color of a pixel.
Handles operations like texture mapping, lighting, and color blending.
Performs per-fragment (per-pixel) operations such as applying shadows, transparency, or post-processing effects.
Input: Receives interpolated data from the vertex shader (e.g., color, texture coordinates, normals).
Output: Provides the final color (and optionally depth and other information) for each pixel.
Example: A fragment shader might use the interpolated texture coordinates from the vertex shader to fetch a color from a texture and apply lighting calculations to determine the final pixel color.

Key Differences:
Stage: The vertex shader operates on vertices (points), while the fragment shader operates on fragments (potential pixels).
Function: The vertex shader focuses on geometry transformations, and the fragment shader focuses on pixel-level coloring and shading.
Execution Frequency: A vertex shader is executed once per vertex, while a fragment shader is executed once per pixel.
Together, the vertex and fragment shaders work in tandem to render 3D objects onto the screen with the desired appearance, from geometry to final color.
